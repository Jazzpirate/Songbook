  \begin{verse}
    It's not \[G]time to make a \[D]change
    Just re\[C]lax, take it \[Am]easy
    You're still \[G]young, that's your \[Em]fault
    There's so \[Am]much you have to \[D]know
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    Find a girl, settle down
    If you want, you can marry
    Look at me, I am old
    But I'm happy
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse}
    I was once like you are now
    And I know that it's not easy
    To be calm when you've found
    Something going on
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    But take your time, think a lot
    Think of everything you've got
    For you will still be here tomorrow
    But your \[D]dreams may \[G]not
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse}
    How can I try to explain?
    When I do, he turns away again
    And it's always been the same
    Same old story
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    From the moment I could talk
    I was ordered to listen
    Now there's a way, and I know
    That I \[D]have to \[G]go away
    I \[D]know, I \[C]have to \[G]go
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse}
    It's not time to make a change
    Just sit down
    And take it slowly
    You're still young, that's your fault
    There's so much you have to go through
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    Find a girl, settle down
    If you want, you can marry
    Look at me, I am old
    But I'm happy
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse}
    All the times, that I've cried
    Keeping all the things I knew inside
    And it's hard
    But it's harder to ignore it
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    If they were right, I'd agree
    But it's them, they know, not me
    Now there's a way, and I know
    I have to go away
    I know I have to go
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse}
    \[Am]Now that I've \[D7]lost everything to \[G]you
    \[G]You say you \[C]wanna start something \[F]new
    \[F]And it's \[Dm]breaking my heart you're \[E]leaving
    \[E]Baby, I'm grievin'
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    But if you want to leave, take good care
    Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
    But then a lot of nice things turn bad, out \[G7]there
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[C]Oh \[G]baby, baby, it's a \[Am]wild \[F]world
    \[G]{It's} hard to get \[F]by, just upon a \[C]smile
    \[C]Oh \[G]baby, baby, it's a \[Am]wild \[F]world
    \[G]{I'll} always remem\[F]ber you like a \[C]child, girl \[D E]
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
    And it's breaking my heart in two
    Because I never want to see you sad, girl
    Don't be a bad girl
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    But if you want to leave, take good care
    Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
    But just remember there's a lot of bad, out there
  \end{verse*}

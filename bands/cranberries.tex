  \begin{verse}
    \[Em]Another \[C]head hangs lowly
    \[G]Child is slowly \[D]taken
    \[Em]And the violence \[C]caused such silence
    \[G]Who are we mis\[D]taken
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    But you \[Em]see, it's not me
    It's not \[C]my family
    In your \[G]head, in your head
    They are figh\[D]ting
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{chorus}
    With their \[Em]tanks and their bombs
    And their \[C]bombs and their guns
    In your \[G]head, in your head
    They are \[D]crying
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    In your \[Em]head, in your \[C]head
    Zombie, \[G]zombie, zombi\[D]e
    What's in your \[Em]head, in your \[C]head
    Zombie, \[G]zombie, zombi\[D]e
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Another mother's breaking
    Heart is taking over
    When the violence causes silence
    We must be mistaken
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    It's the same old theme
    Since 1916
    In your head, in your head
    They're still fighting
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{chorus}
    With their tanks and their bombs
    And their bombs and their guns
    In your head, in your head
    They're dying
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    In your head, in your head
    Zombie, zombie, zombie
    What's in your head, in your head
    Zombie, zombie, zombie
  \end{chorus}

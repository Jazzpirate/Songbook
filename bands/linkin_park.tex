\beginverse
\[Em] Memories consume
Like opening the wound
\[Em] I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[C]I don't want to \[Am]be the one
The \[C]battles always choose \[Em/B]
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused
\endverse
\beginchorus
I \[Em]don't know what's worth \[C]fighting for
Or \[Em/B]why I have to scream
I \[Em]don't know why I \[C]instigate
And \[Em/B]say what I don't mean
I \[Em]don't know how I \[C]got this way
I \[Em/B]know it's not alright
So I'm \[C]breaking the \[D9]habit
I'm \[C]breaking the \[D9]habit tonight
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Em] Clut\[D]ching my \[Em]cure
I \[D/F#]tightly lock the door
\[Em] I \[D]try to catch my \[Em]breath again \[D/F#]
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again
\endverse
\beginverse*
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
\[Em] I'll paint it on the \[D/F#]walls
\[G] 'Cause I'm the one at \[Am]fault
\[Em] I'll never fight a\[D/F#]gain
\[G] And this is how it \[Am]ends

  \begin{verse}
    \[Em]I'm tired of being what you \[C]want me to be
    \[G]Feeling so faithless lost \[D]under the surface
    \[Em]I don't know what you're expe\[C]cting of me
    Put \[G]under the pressure of \[D]walking in your sh\[C]oes \[D]
    \echo{Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
    Every s\[Em]tep I take is a\[G]nother mistake to \[C]you \[D]
    \echo{Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[Em]I've become so nu\[C]mb I can't feel you t\[G]here
    I've become so ti\[D]red so much more \[Em]aware
    I've becoming \[C]this all I want to \[G]do
    Is be more like \[D]me and be less like \[Em]you
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Can't you see that you're smothering me
    Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
    Cause everything that you thought I would be
    Has fallen apart right in front of you
    \echo{Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
    Every step that I take is another mistake to you
    \echo{Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
    And every second I waste is more than I can take
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    And I \[D]know
    I may \[Em]end \[G]up \[Em]fail\[D]ing \[C]too
    But I \[D]know
    You were j\[B]ust like me with someone disappointed in you
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    I've become so numb I can't feel you there
    Is everything what you want me to be
    I've become so numb I can't feel you there
    Is everything what you want me to be
  \end{verse*}

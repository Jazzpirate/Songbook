  \begin{chorus}
    \[C]My heart is beating like a \[G]jungle \[D]drum \rep{2}
    \[C]My heart is beating like a \[G]jungle \[Em]drum

  \begin{verse}
    Man, you got me burning
    I'm the moment between the striking and the fire
    Hey, read my lips
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    Cause all they say is kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
    No, it'll never stop
    My hands are in the air, yes I'm in love

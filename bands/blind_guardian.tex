Now you all know
The bards and their songs

When hours have gone by
I'll close my eyes
In a world far away
We may meet again

But now hear my song
About the dawn of the night

Let's sing the bards' song
\endverse
\beginchorus
To\[Dm]mor\[Am]row will \[Dm]take us a\[Am]way
\[Dm]Far from \[Am]home
\[Dm]No one will \[F]ever \[G]know our \[Dm]names
But the \[F]bards' songs \[G]will re\[Am]main
To\[Dm]mor\[Am]row will \[Dm]take it away
The \[Dm]fear of to\[Am]day
\[Dm]It will be \[Fm]gone
Due \[Am]to our magic songs
\endchorus
\beginverse
There's only one song
Left in my mind
Tales of a brave man
Who lived far from here
Now the bard songs are over
And it's time to leave
No one should ask you for the name
Of the one
Who tells the story
\endverse
\beginchorus
Tomorrow will take us away
Far from home
No one will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow all will be known
And you're not alone
So don't be afraid
In the dark and cold
\endchorus
\beginverse*
'Cause the \[F]bards' songs \[G]will re\[C]m\[G/B]a\[Am]ain
They \[C]all \[G/B]will re\[Am]main
In my thoughts and in my dreams
They're always in my mind
These songs of hobbits, dwarves and men
And elves
Come close your eyes
You can \[C]see \[G/B]them \[Em]too
\endverse

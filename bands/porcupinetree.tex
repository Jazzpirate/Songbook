\beginverse
I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And are you experienced
Into a suburban heaven
Yeah it should've been forever
It all seems to make so much sense
\endverse
\gtab{Gj7/13}{V:354000} \gtab{Cj7}{V:X35400}
\beginchorus
But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies
\endchorus
\beginverse
She said luck is what you make it
You just reach out and take it
Now let's dance a while
She said nothing ever happens
If you don't make it happen
And if you can't laugh and smile
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginchorus
And laughing in the summer showers
That's still the way I see you now
\endchorus
\beginverse*
How does time break down
With no marker, things slow down.
A conference of the strange
And your family is deranged
\endverse
\beginverse
I could tell you what I'm thinking
While we sit here drinking
But I'm not sure where to start
You see there's something wrong here
I'm sorry if I'm not clear
Can you stop smoking your cigar
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginchorus
And the coat you wore to Alton Towers
Is still the way I see you now
\endchorus

\beginverse
Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The \[C/G]hiss of the \[A7]train at the \[Am7]railway \[Em]head
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[A]A-\[Am]a-\[C/G]always the sum-\[Cj7/G]mers
are \[D]slipping a-\[A]way \[C/G] \[Cj7/G]
\endchorus
\beginverse
A 60 ton angel falls to the earth
A pile of old metal, a radiant blur
Scars in the country, the summer and her
\endverse
\beginchorus
Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay
\endchorus
\beginverse*
When I hear the engine pass
I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides
I'm in luck
When the evening reaches here
You're tying me up
I'm dying of love
It's OK
\endverse

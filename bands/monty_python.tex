\newsong{Always Look on the Bright Side of Life}

  \begin{verse}
    Some \[Am]things in life are \[D]bad, they can \[G]really make you \[Em]mad
    Other \[Am]things just make you \[D]swear and \[G]curse
    When you've \[Am]chewing an life's \[D]gristle, don't \[G]grumble, give a \[Em]whistle
    And \[Am]this'll help things turn out for the \[D7]best
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    And \[G]always \[Em]look on the \[Am]bright \[D7]side of \[G]life \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
    Al\[G]ways \[Em]look on the \[Am]light \[D7]side of \[G]life \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
  \end{chorus}

    \begin{verse}
      If \[Am]life seems jolly \[D]rotten, there's \[G]something you've \[Em]forgotten
      And that's to \[Am]laugh and smile and \[D]dance and \[G]sing
      When you've \[Am]feeling in the \[D]dumps, don't be \[G]silly \[Em]chumps
      Just \[Am]purse your lips and whistle - that's the \[D7]thing
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
      And \[G]always \[Em]look on the \[Am]bright \[D7]side of \[G]life \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
      Al\[G]ways \[Em]look on the \[Am]bright \[D7]side of \[G]life \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
    \end{chorus}

    \begin{verse}
      For l\[Am]ife is quite abs\[D]urd, and d\[G]eath's the final w\[Em]ord
      You must \[Am]always face the \[D]curtains with a \[G]bow
      For\[Am]get about your \[D]sin - give the \[G]audience a \[Em]grin
      En\[Am]joy it - it's your last chance any\[D7]how
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
      So \[G]always \[Em]look on the \[Am]bright \[D7]side of \[G]death \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
      J\[G]ust be\[Em]fore you \[Am]draw your ter\[D7]minal \[G]breath \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
    \end{chorus}

    \begin{verse}
      \[Am]Life's a piece of \[D]shit, \[G]when you look at \[Em]it
      \[Am]Life's a laugh and \[D]death's a joke it's \[G]true
      You'll \[Am]see it's all a \[D]show, keep'em \[G]laughing as you \[Em]go
      Just re\[Am]member that the last laugh is on \[D7]you
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
      And \[G]always \[Em]look on the \[Am]bright \[D7]side of \[G]life \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
      Al\[G]ways \[Em]look on the \[Am]right \[D7]side of \[G]life \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
    \end{chorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[A]Always \[F#]look on the \[Bm]bright \[E7]side of \[A]life \[F#] \[Bm] \[E7]
    \[A]Always \[F#]look on the \[Bm]right \[E7]side of \[A]life \[F#] \[Bm] \[E7]

\beginverse*
When-\[F6]ever life gets you \[B]down Mrs. Brown
And \[F6]things seem hard or \[B]tough
And \[F6]people are stupid, ob-\[B]noxious or \[G#7]daft
And you \[C#m7]feel that you've had quite e-\[F#7]nough...
\endverse
\beginverse
Just, re-\[B]member that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at nine hundred miles an \[F#7]hour
That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned
A sun that is the source of all our \[B]power
\endverse
\beginverse*
The \[B]sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see
Are \[G#7]moving at a million miles a \[C#m7]day
In an\[E]outer spiral \[Fdim]arm at forty \[B/F#]thousand miles an \[G#7]hour
Of the \[C#m7]galaxy we \[F#7]call the Milky \[B]Way
{\nolyrics \[E] \[Fdim] \[B/F#] \[G#7] \[C#m7] \[F#7] \[B] \[F#7]}
\endverse
\beginverse
Our galaxy itself, contains a hundred billion stars
It's a hundred thousand light years side-to-side
It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick
But out by us its just three thousand light years wide
\endverse
\beginverse*
We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point
We go round every two hundred million years
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe
\endverse
\beginverse
The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
In all of the directions it can whiz
As fast as it can go, the speed of light you know
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is
\endverse\beginverse*
So remember when you're feeling very small and insecure
How amazingly unlikely is your birth
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space
Cause there's bugger-all down here on Earth
\endverse

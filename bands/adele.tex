    \[Am]There's a fire \[E]starting in my heart
    \[G]Reaching a fever pitch and it's \[E]bringing me out the dark

  \endverse

  \beginverse*
      \[Am]See how I leave with \[E]every piece of you
      \[G]Don't underestimate the \[E]things that I will do
      \[Am]There's a fire \[E]starting in my heart
      \[G]Reaching a fever pitch and it's \[E]bringing me out the dark
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    \[F] The scars of \[G]your love, remind me \[Em]of us
    They keep me \[F]thinking that we almost had it all
    \[F] The scars of \[G]your love, they leave me \[Em]breathless
    I can't help \[E]feeling
  \endverse

  \endchorus

  \beginverse
      \[Am]Baby I have no \[E]story to be told
      But \[G]{I've} heard one of you and I'm \[E]gonna make your head burn
      \[Am]Think of me in the \[E]depths of your despair
      \[G]Making a home down there, as mine \[E]sure won't be shared
    \endverse

    \beginverse*
      \[Am]Throw your soul through \[E]every open door
      \[G]Count your blessings to \[E]find what you look for
      \[Am]Turn my sorrow \[E]into treasured gold
      You'll \[G]pay me back in kind and \[E]reap just what you've sown

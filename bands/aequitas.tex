\beginverse
He es-\[Cm]caped from the \[A&]island
Our \[G]strong captain \[Cm]Jack
He bound \[A&]turtles to-\[Eb]gether
With \[B&]hair from his \[Cm]back
Left \[Cm]alone with a \[A&]gun
To look \[Fm]death in the \[Cm]eye
But Red \[A&]Bull gave him \[Cm]wings
And he \[G]learned how to fly
\endverse
\beginverse
So he traveled with the guy
From the Lord of the Rings
To the islands of Tortuga
Where he had a few flings
He drafted a crew
To find the Isla de Muerta
And with blood from a bootstrap
He got rid of the curse

And the \[Cm]pearl with its \[B&]crew
Sails the \[E&]ocean \[B&]tonight
And the \[E&]darkness re-\[G]veals
Every \[Cm]wound \[G]can be \[Cm]healed
And the \[Cm]moonlight dis-\[B&]plays
What may \[E&]hide from your \[A&]sight
When your \[Cm]eyes are \[Fm]blinded
By \[G]daylight

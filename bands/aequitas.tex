He es-\[Cm]caped from the \[A&]island
Our \[G]strong captain \[Cm]Jack
He bound \[A&]turtles to-\[E&]gether
With \[B&]hair from his \[Cm]back
Left \[Cm]alone with a \[A&]gun
To look \[Fm]death in the \[Cm]eye
But Red \[A&]Bull gave him \[Cm]wings
And he \[G]learned how to fly
\endverse
\beginverse
So he \[Cm]traveled with the \[A&]guy
From the \[G]Lord of the \[Cm]Rings
To the \[A&]islands of Tor\[E&]tuga
Where he \[B&]had a few \[Cm]flings
He \[Cm]drafted a \[A&]crew
To find the \[Fm]Isla de Mu\[Cm]erta
And with \[A&]blood from a \[Cm]bootstrap
He got \[G]rid of the curse

\[Cm]Oh \[A&]Yeah, \[E&]he is a \[B&]Pirate
\[Fm]Yo \[Cm]Ho, \[G]king of the \[Cm]sea

\beginverse*
And the \[Cm]pearl with its \[B&]crew
Sails the \[E&]ocean \[B&]tonight
And the \[E&]darkness re-\[G]veals
Every \[Cm]wound \[G]can be \[Cm]healed
And the \[Cm]moonlight dis-\[B&]plays
What may \[E&]hide from your \[A&]sight
When your \[Cm]eyes are \[Fm]blinded
By \[G]daylight

  \begin{verse*}
    It's the edge of the world

    Space may be the final frontier

    First born unicorn
    Hardcore soft porn

  \begin{verse*}
    Destruction leads to a very rough road
    But it also breeds creation
    And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
    They're just another good vibration
    And tidal waves couldn't save the world
    From Californication
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Pay your surgeon very well
    To break the spell of aging
    Sicker than the rest there is no test

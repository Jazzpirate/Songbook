\newsong{Bed of Roses}
 \beginverse
I'm \[B&]sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old pi\[F]ano
Trying \[B&]hard to capture the moment
This morning I \[F]don't know
\endverse
\beginverse*
'Cause a \[Am]bottle of vodka's still \[B&]lodged in my head
And some \[F]blond gave me nightmares
I think she's still in my \[B&]bed
As I \[B&]dream about movies they \[C]won't make of me when I'm \[F]dead
\endverse

\beginverse
With an ironclad fist
I wake up, and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat
In my head while we're talking
\endverse
\beginverse*
About all of the things, that I long to believe
About love, the truth, what you mean to me
And the truth is
\[B&]Baby, you're all that I \[C]need \[C/E]
\endverse

\beginchorus
I wanna \[Dm]lay
You \[C]down in a \[B&]bed of \[F]roses
For to\[Dm]night
I \[C]sleep on a \[B&]bed of \[F]nails
Oh, I want to \[B&]be
Just as \[F]close as
The \[B&]Holy \[F]Ghost is
And \[Dm]lay \[C]you \[B&]down
  On a bed of \[F]roses
\endchorus

\beginverse
Well I'm so far away
Each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes
Given each night to see through this payphone
\endverse
\beginverse*
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire
Flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes, whisper
Baby, blind love is true
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus - C}
\beginverse*
Well this \[B&]hotel bar hangover
\[C]Whiskey's gone dry
The bar\[F]keeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I \[B&]might have said yeah
But I \[B&]laughed so hard \[C]I think I \[F]died, \[C/E]uh yeah!...
\endverse
\textnote{Solo Chorus}
\beginverse
Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got \[Dm]nothing to \[C]prove for it's \[B&]you
That I'd die to de\[F]fend \[C]
\endverse

\beginverse
You want com\[D]mitment take a \[G]look into these eyes
They burn with \[D]fire, un\[G]til the end of time
I would do \[Bm]anything; I'd beg, I'd steal, I'd \[G]die
To have you \[A]in these arms to\[D]night
\endverse
\beginverse
Baby I want you like the roses want the rain
You know I need you like a poet needs the pain
I would give anything; my blood my love my life.
If you were in these arms tonight
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[D] I'd hold you, \[A] I'd need you
\[Bm] I'd get down \[G]on my knees for you
\[D] And make \[Bm]everything al\[A]right
If you were \[G]in these \[A]arms
\[D] I'd love you, \[A] I'd please you
\[Bm] I'd tell you that I'd \[G]never leave you
\[D] And love you \[G]till the end of \[A]time 
If you were \[G]in these \[A]arms \[D] tonight
\endchorus
\beginverse
We stared at the sun and we made a promise
A promise this world would never blind us
 \endverse
 \beginverse*
These are my \[Bm]words
Our words were our \[G]songs
Our songs are our \[Bm]prayers
These prayers keep me strong
And I still be\[G]lieve
 If you were \[A]in these arms
 \endverse
 \textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
Your \[A]clothes are still scattered all over our room
This \[G]whole place still smells like your cheap perfume
\[A]Everything here reminds me of you 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
\endverse
\textnote{Solo: D A Bm G  | D A G}
\beginverse*
\[G] And these were our \[A]words They keep me strong

[Verse 1]
\beginverse
Mother \[G]mother tell your \[B&]children 
That their \[C]time has just be\[G]gun
I have \[G]suffered for \[B&]my anger
There are \[C]wars that can't be \[E&]won \[F]
\endverse
\beginverse*
Father \[G]father please be\[B&]lieve me
I am \[C]laying down my \[G]guns
I am \[G]broken like an \[B&]arrow
For\[C]give me, for\[E&]give your \[F]wayward son
\endverse
\beginverse*
(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Mother mother (everybody needs somebody to hate)
Please believe me
(Everybody's bitching 'cause they can't get enough) 
And it's hard to hold on when there's no one to lean on
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G] Faith! 
You \[B&]know you're gonna live thru the \[F]rain
\[C]Lord you got to keep the \[G]faith
Faith!
\[B&]Don't let your love turn to \[F]hate 
Right \[C]now we got to keep the \[G]faith
\[G] Keep the faith, keep the faith Lord we got to keep the faith
\endchorus

\beginverse
Tell me baby when I hurt you 
Do you keep it all inside
Do you tell me all's forgiven 
And just hide behind your pride
\endverse
\beginverse*
(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Mother mother (Everybody needs somebody to hate)
Please believe me 
(Everybody's bleeding 'cause the times are tough)
And it's hard to be strong when there's no one to dream on
\endverse

\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
Walking in the footsteps of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever to stand out in the rain 
So no one sees me cryin' trying to wash away the pain
\endverse
\beginverse
Mother father, there's things I've done I can't erase
And every night we fall from grace
It's hard with the world in your face
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on.
\endverse

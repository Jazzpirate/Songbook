\tab{disney_letitgo1}
\beginverse
The \[Em]snow glows white on the \[C]mountain tonight
Not a \[D]footprint to be \[Asus4]seen \[Am]
A \[Em]kingdom of isola-\[C]tion
And it \[D]looks like I'm the \[Asus4]queen \[A]
\[Em] The wind is \[C]howling like this \[D]swirling storm in-\[Asus4]side \[Am]
\[Em] Couldn't keep it \[D]in, heaven knows I've \[A]tried
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[D] Don't let them in, don't let them see
\[C] Be the good girl you always have to be
\[D] Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
\[C] Well, \[C9]now they know
\endverse
\beginchorus
Let it \[G]go, let it \[Dsus4/F#]go
Can't \[Em7]hold it back any-\[C9]more
Let it \[G]go, let it \[Dsus4/F#]go
Turn a-\[Em7]way and slam the \[C9]door
\[G]I don't care\[Dsus4/F#] what they're \[Em7]going to say \[C9]
Let the \[Bm7]storm rage on \[B&]
The \[C]cold never bothered me anyway
\endchorus
\beginverse
{\nolyrics \[G] \[Dsus4/F#]}
\[Em] It's funny how some \[C]distance
makes \[D]everything seem \[Am]small
And the \[Em]fears that once con-\[D]trolled me
can't \[Asus4]get to me at \[A]all
\endverse
\beginverse*
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
\endverse
\beginchorus
[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on
\endchorus

\textnote{C}
\beginverse*
\[C] My power flurries through the air into the ground
\[C] My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
\[D] And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
\[Em] I'm never \[C]going back, the \[D]past is in the past
{\nolyrics \[Am] \[C]}
\endverse
\beginchorus
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
\endchorus

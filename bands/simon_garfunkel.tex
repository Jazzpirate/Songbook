  \begin{chorus}
    \[D] And here's to \[G]you Mrs. \[Em]Robinson
    \[G]Jesus loves you \[Em]more than you will \[C]know, \echo{wo wo \[Am]wo}
    \[D]God bless you \[G]please Mrs. \[Em]Robinson
    \[G]Heaven holds a \[Em]place for those who \[C]pray, \echo{hey hey \[Am]hey}
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    \[E7]We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
    \[A]We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
    \[D]Look around you, \[G]all you see are \[C]sympathetic \[Am]eyes
    \[E7]Stroll around the grounds un\[D]til you feel at home
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
    Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
    It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair
    Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
    Going to the candidates debate
    Laugh about it, shout about it, when you've got to choose
    Any way you look at it you lose
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?
    A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, \echo{wo wo wo}
    What's that you say Mrs. Robinson?
    Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, \echo{hey hey hey, hey hey hey}
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[Am]Are you going to \[Em]Scarborough \[Am]Fair
    \[C] Parsley, \[Am]sage, rose\[C]ma\[D]ry and \[Am]thyme
    Remember \[C]me to one who lives \[G]there
    \[Am]She once \[G]was a \[Am]true love \[Em]of \[Am]mine
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
    \echo{On the side of a hill in the deep forest green}
    Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
    \echo{Tracing of sparrow on snow crested brown}
    Without no seams nor needle work
    \echo{Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain}
    Then she'll be a true love of mine
    \echo{Sleeps unaware of the clarion call}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Tell her to find me an acre of land
    \echo{On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves}
    Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
    \echo{Washes the grave with silvery tears}
    Between the salt water and the sea strands
    \echo{A soldier cleans and polishes a gun}
    Then she'll be a true love of mine
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
    \echo{War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions}
    Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
    \echo{Generals order their soldiers to kill}
    And gather it all in a bunch of heather
    \echo{And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten}
    Then she'll be a true love of mine
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Are you going to Scarborough Fair
    Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
    Remember me to one who lives there
    She was once a true love of mine

\newsong{The Sound of Silence}
  \begin{verse}
    \[Am]Hello darkness, my old \[G]friend
    I've come to talk with you a\[Am]gain
    Because a vi\[C]sion sof\[F]tly cree\[C]ping
    Left its seeds while I \[F]was slee\[C]ping
    And the \[F]vision that was planted in my \[C]brain
    Still re\[Am]mains
    Wi\[C]thin the \[G]sound of \[Am]silence
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    In restless dreams I walked alone
    Narrow streets of cobblestone
    Neath the halo of a street lamp
    I turned my collar to the cold and damp
    When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
    That split the night
    And touched the sound of silence
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    And in the naked light I saw
    Ten thousand people, maybe more
    People talking without speaking
    People hearing without listening
    People writing songs that voices never share
    And no one dared
    Disturb the sound of silence
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    ``Fools'' said I, ``You don't know
    Silence's like a cancer grows
    Hear my words and I might teach you
    Take my arms and I might reach you''
    But my words like silence raindrops fell
    And echoed
    In the wells of silence
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    And the people bowed and prayed
    To the neon god they made
    And the sign flashed out its warning
    In the words that it was forming
    And the sign said, ``The words of the prophets
    Are written on the subway walls, and tenement halls''
    And whispered in the sound of silence
  \end{verse}

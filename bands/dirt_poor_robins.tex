\beginverse
\[F#m] Wake you \[C#]sleepers it's \[D]time to get \[A]dressed
\[Bm] Somebody's \[B7]coming so you \[G#7]better look your \[C#7]best
\[F#m ]Cause out in the \[C#]garden there's \[D]things you hid a\[A]way
\[Bm] But the grass has \[B7]withered and the \[G#7]flower's begun to \[C#7]fade
\endverse
\beginverse*
And there's \[D]nowhere left to hide it
Someone's sure to find it
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[F#m] All of the \[C#]world (all of the)
\[D] All of the \[A]world (all of the)
\[Bm] All of the \[B7]world (soon to be)
\[G#7] Soon to be \[C#7]gone (soon to be)
\[F#m] All of the \[C#]world (all of the)
\[D]All of the \[A]world
\[Bm]All of the \[B7]world
\[G#7] Soon to be \[C#7]gone
\endchorus
\beginverse
Dear Mr. Thoughtless there's things you shouldn't say
For the judge can hear you and it soon will be the day
Well, he'll bring the words you spoke and lay them at your feet
Syllables and decibels, he didn't miss a beat
\endverse
\beginverse*
And we'll \[D]see what you can do to try to buy and lie your way outta this one, pal
Cause the \[D]world is \[C#]gonna be \[F#m]gone, gone
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
\[C#] We are the \[C#7]guilty of im\[F#]portance
(\[A]Playing \[B]life is hard)
\[C#] We borrow \[C#7]daddy and the \[F#]Porsche
(Stealing \[A]poorly \[B]from the farm)
\[C#] But we want it, \[C#7] we need a \[F#]chance in here
Or \[A]else we're just like \[B]everybody \[F#]else
Is that \[F#m]wrong?
\endverse
\beginverse
Romans and countrymen please lend me your ears
There's some late breaking news, I know you'd like to hear
But the papers won't print it and the TV's just won't air
Nobody gets the word 'cause there's nobody there
\endverse
\beginverse*
As the \[D]scales were set and the measurements taken
Old chief left for a \[D]great va\[C#]cation
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Cm]Love, your enemy is \[G]time
It's too soon to set it \[E&]straight
Too late to keep you \[A&]on the narrow
\[Cm]For this pressure on my \[G]chest,
That never lets me \[E&]rest 
Is building with each \[A&]new tomorrow
\endverse
\beginverse*
For \[Fm]what we needed most, was only just a ghost
\endverse
\beginchorus
A \[E&]vapor \[Gm(/D)]trail, a \[A&]plane gone by
A \[E&]bridge of \[Gm(/D)]smoke that \[A&]fades before our eyes
\[Am7&5] We'd cross the rope, but our \[B&]balance is a \[(G)]joke
We're \[$B^o$]human after \[A&j7]all, \[/G&] \[/F&]
\[/E&]still there's \[Gsus4/D]no ex\[G]cuse to \[Cm]fall
\endchorus
\beginverse
This mortal will, more rust than flesh
Turned by the creeping bitterness
Aging machines, no soul to offer
Crushed by the burdens of ours fears
Carried alone for all these years
Programmed to flee, too weak to bother
\endverse
\beginverse*
What we needed most was only just a ghost
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
A\[Fm]fraid of letting go, we \[A&m]claw the dirt and move the earth
Re\[Cm]claiming the rotting \[/B]vessels \[/B&] of our \[/A]love
\[Fm]Animating corpses to \[A&m]dance like they're rejoicing 
As the \[Cm]audience is \[/B]stifled by the \[/B&]actors in our \[/A]show
But it \[G]must go \[Cm]on
\endverse
\beginverse
We were the cause, we are at fault
We cannot draw from empty vaults
With vacant hands, we're left to ponder
If only then we had been told, infatuations would grow cold
We might have more than ash to squander
I'll always wonder...
\endverse
\beginverse*
Was it a \[E&]vapor \[Gm/D]trail? \[Cm]
A vapor trail
Are we a vapor trail?
\[E&]Vapor tra\[D&]-\[Cm]ail

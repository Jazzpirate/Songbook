\newsong{Rains of Castamere}
\beginverse*
And \[Em]who are you the proud lord said
That I most bow so \[D]low?
\[G]Only a cat of a different coat
That's \[Am]all the truth I \[B]know
\endverse
\beginverse*
In a coat of gold or a coat of red
A lion still has claws
And mine are long and sharp, my lord
As \[Am]long and \[B]sharp as \[Em]yours
\endverse
\beginchorus
And \[Em]so he spoke, and \[Bm]so he spoke
That \[Em]lord of Casta\[Bm]mere
And \[C]Now the rains weep \[Am]o'er his hall
With \[C]no one \[B]there to \[Em]hear

And \[C]Now the rains weep \[Am]o'er his hall
With \[C]no one \[B]there to \[Em]hear
\endchorus

Hear me, what I've got to say
I know you and get you anyway
See me walking by your side
I'm with you forever day and night
\endverse
\beginchorus
Hey man, I'm your worst choice
You don't know, I want it so
Hey man, I'm your dark voice
You don't know where we will go
Straight to hell, straight to hell
\endchorus
\beginverse
Listen, listen what you say
I've taught you and you have learned your lesson
Feel me, when you feel the pain
I want you and I am going to get you.. anyway
\endverse
\beginverse*
I look like the easy way
The truth to be found
I seem to be innocent
I'm coming around, I'm coming around
\endverse
\beginchorus
I'm your worst choice
You don't know, I want it so
Hey man, I'm your dark voice
You don't know where we will go
You don't know where we will go
Straight to hell, straight to hell
\endchorus
\beginverse*
I look like the easy way
The truth to be found
I seem to be innocent
I'm coming around, I'm coming around

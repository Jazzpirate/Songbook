\newsong{Inflatable You}
\beginverse
Your love for me is not de-\[E&6]batable
\[ C7] Your sexual appetite's in-\[Fm7]satiable
\[B&7] You never ever make me \[Fm7]waitable
De-\[B&7]lectable, inflatable \[E&6]you. \[B&7]
\endverse
\beginverse
You don't have problems with your weight at all
You never steal food off my plate at all
I never have to masturbate at all
Unstoppable, inflatable you.
\endverse
\beginverse
You never seem to menstruate at all
So you're not angry when I'm late at all
I feel permanently felatable
Unpoppable, inflatable \[E&6]you.
\endverse
\beginchorus
With \[Ej7]you in my arms I \[C#m7]feel we could just fly a-\[G#m7]way
With the \[A]right kind of gas I \[F#m7]might even try it some 
\[G#m7]day \[C#7] \[F#m7] \[B7]
In this \[Ej7]ocean of life I'm \[C#m7]never afraid we might\[G#m7]drown
We could \[A]just float forever what-\[F#m7]ever the weather
When-\[G#m7]ever my in-\[C#7]flatable \[F#m7]lover's a-\[B7]round. \[B&7]
\endchorus
\beginverse
Your thighs and buttocks are so holdable
You always do what you are toldable
And if we argue you just foldable
Controllable consolable you.
\endverse
\beginverse
My mates all reckon you are suitable
I took you 'round to watch the foodtable
And Steve and Gary said you're rootable
Commutable, refutable you.
\endverse
\beginverse
You're never sensitive or tickley
When I rub you my skin goes prickerly
It's know an static electricity
Felicity when I'm kissing you.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Your skin is so smooth, I couldn't afford you with hair
You have all the holes real girls have got plus one for the air
Your problems are simple, I don't need my Masters in Psych
To know if you get down I just perk you right up
With a couple of squirts from the pump off my bike.
\endchorus
\beginverse
You never wake up when I snore at all
A trait which I find quite adorable
You have a box and you are storable
Ignorable, back-doorable you.
\endverse
\beginverse
Any sexual position's feasible
Although you don't bend at the knees at all
Your hooters are so firm and squeezable
Increasable, un-creasable you.
\endverse
\beginverse
You don't complain about my hairy back
Or 'bout the inches that downstairs I lack
You're not disgusted by my furry crack
Burt Bacharach, Jack Kerouac ooo.
\endverse
\beginverse
Now birth control is not an issue
I clean it all up with a tissue
I bet my jealous friend all wish you
Were insatiably inflatably theirs.
\endverse
\beginverse*
Don’t let me down.
Don’t let me down.
Don’t let me down.
And I won’t let you down.
\endverse

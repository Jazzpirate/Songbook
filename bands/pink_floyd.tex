    \[Bm]Hello
    Is there anybody \[A]in there?

      Can you \[Bm]show me where it hurts?
    \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[D] There is no pain you are \[A]receding
    \[D] A distant ship's smoke on the \[A]horizon
    \[C] You are only coming through in \[G]waves
    Your \[C]lips move but I can't hear what you're s\[G]aying
    When \[D]I was a child I had a f\[A]ever
    My \[D]hands felt just like two ball\[A]oons

\beginverse
	\[B/E&] I still \[Em]smell of \[Cm]sweat
	\[B/E&] Still the \[Em]scent of my \[Cm]giving in
	\[B/E&] Try to \[Em]feel re-\[Cm]gret
	\[B/E&] But I \[Em]want it to \[Cm]stay on my skin

	\[B/E&] I still \[Em]fanta-\[Cm]size
	\[B/E&] Close my \[Em]eyes to be \[Cm]wrong again
	\[B/E&] Still those \[Em]fuck-me \[Cm]eyes
	\[B/E&] As I'm \[Em]licking the \[D&]palm of my hand
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[Em]How the hell am I supposed to 
\[C]keep myself when you are so damn 
\[Em]far away, and everything feels 
\[C]meaningless, and I am not mine\rep{2}
\endchorus
\beginverse
I still smell of sex
Still her taste on my fingertips
Try to feel remorse
But it's hard with her wet on my lips
\endverse
\beginchorus
How the hell am I supposed to 
keep myself, when you are so damn 
far away, and everything feels 
meaningless, and I am not mine

How the hell am I supposed to 
keep myself, when you are so damn 
far away, and all I do seems
meaningless, and I am not mine
\endchorus
\beginverse*
I need something of my own
Something with a locked door
A room just for me alone
Something that I can control

\[Em] I need something of my own
\[C] I need something cutting to the
\[Am]bone, I need something that is 
\[Am]mine \[Bm] If \[C]that must be \[D]guilt, then 
\[Em]fine, I wanted something nice, but 
\[C]fine, this guilt is a hole but it's 
\[Am]mine, I wanted something 
\[Am]nice, \[Bm] this \[C]guilt is a \[D]hole but it's 
mine!

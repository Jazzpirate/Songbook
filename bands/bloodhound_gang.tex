Sweat, baby, sweat, baby 
Sex is a Texas drought me and you 
Do the kind of stuff that only 
Prince would sing about, so put your 
Hands down my pants and I'll 
Bet you'll feel nuts, yes, I'm 
Siskel, yes I'm Ebert and you're 
Getting two thumbs up, you've had e-
nough of two-hand touch, you want it 
Rough, you're out of bounds, I want you 
Smothered, want you covered, like my 
Waffle House hash browns, come quicker than Fed
Ex, never reaching apex like Coca-Cola
Stock you are inclined to make me 
Rise an hour early just like 
Daylight Savings Time
\endverse
\beginchorus
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Do it again now)
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Gettin' horny now)
\endchorus
\beginverse
Love, the kind you clean up 
With a mop and bucket, like the 
Lost catacombs of Egypt, only 
God knows where we stuck it, hiero-
glyphics, let me be Pacific, I want to be 
Down in your South Seas, but I got this 
Notion that the motion of your ocean, means small 
Craft advisory, so if I cap-
size in your thighs, high tide, B5, you 
Sunk my battle ship please turn me 
On, I'm Mr. Coffee with an 
Automatic drip, so show me 
Yours I'll show you mine, ``Tool Time'', you'll 
Love it just like Lyle, and then we'll 
Do it doggie style, so we can 
Both watch X-Files

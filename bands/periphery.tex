\newsong{Catch Fire}
\beginverse
Lock eyes like we're staring down the barrel of a 
shotgun (aaaah)
Appear so quickly, leave as 
swiftly as you came
Sometimes I wish I had the measure of a wise man
But I set the mood, plant the tomb and 
bury all the bones within
\endverse
\beginverse*
It sure is something when we all catch fire
Bodies burning like the sunrise
\endverse
\beginchorus
Stay with me I'll show you paradise
It feels so right
Give me that peace of mind, I'll give you 
everything just
Know it feels so good that I could die
And be alright
\endchorus
\beginverse
Alive we breathe when 
everything is as it seems, but is there 
something much more?
Underneath the sheets, beneath the skin
There's a beauty waiting to be adored
\endverse
\beginverse*
We're cradled in the thick of it 
but too ignorant to give a shit
We set the mood, we plant the tomb
and bury all the bones within
Don't keep me hanging from the mouth
\endverse
\beginverse*
It sure is something when we all catch fire
Bodies burning like the sunrise
\endverse
\beginchorus
Stay with me I'll show you paradise
It feels so right
Give me that peace of mind, I'll give you 
everything just
Know it feels so good that I could die
And join the stars
Give me that peace of mind, I'll give you 
everything just
Stay with me
I'll show you paradise
It feels so right
\endchorus
\beginverse*
We exist in this moment only to 
fly, just stay with me
Twisting love as we hold it on the 
inside, just stay with me

It sure is something when we all catch fire
Bodies burning like the sunrise
\endverse*

\beginverse*
\[C]Wake up as I stumble into a 
\[D]blinding light
\[C] Deeper breaths enough to 
\[Em]kill the highest \[G]highs
\[C] Take one good look I'm 
at the lowest \[D]low again
\[C] Down at the \[Em]bottom, but I'm \[G]fine
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[Am] Tears march to lullabies and 
beat \[Dsus2] me like a \[F]drum
\[Am] It's not your a-\[C]verage fucking mi-\[F]sery

\[Am] This heart has chords, but not a 
\[Dsus2]single one sounds \[F]new or fun
\[Am] Hit strings in \[C]dissonance
Pick \[F]on, and on, and on
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[Am]Show them how to \[C]fly away
\[Em]when this world is \[D]torn
\[Am]If you feel like \[C]dying, lose that 
fore-\[G]ver, you're shining and it \[D]shows
\endchorus
\beginverse*
\[C] You're \[D]shining and it 
\[C]shows, living \[Em]through the highest \[D]highs
\[C] You're \[D]shining and it 
\[C]shows, down at the \[Em]bottom, but I'm \[G]fine
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[Am] I try to feed it, but it still wants more
Give me that feeling that I'm 
\[C]looking for \[G]

\[C]Wake up
As I stumble into a

\[C] Deeper breaths enough to

\[C] Take one look and I'm 
at the lowest \[D]low a-\[C]gain
 \[Em]At the bottom, \[G]but I'm 
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[Em] fine, at the \[G]bottom, but it's
\[Am]all so wrong \[G/B]
\[C]Wake up, at the \[D]bottom, but it's
\[Am]all so wrong

\[E5] Tears march to lullabies and 
beat me like a \[F#5]drum \[C5]
\[A5] It's not your average fucking misery
{\nolyrics \[B5]  \[F#-A]}
\[C5] This heart as chords, but not a 
single one sounds new or fun
\[A5 - G5 - A5]{So long to} sanity
For now that's how it \[B5]goes \[D5]\rep{2}

  \beginverse
    A hundred \[Am]days have made me older
    Since the last\[G] time that I saw your pretty face \[Am F G]
    A thousand \[Am]lies have made me colder
    And I \[G]don't think I can look at this the same\[Am F G]
    \[Am] All the miles that sepa\[G]rate
    \[Am] Disappear now when I'm d\[F]reamin' of y\[G]our face
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    \[C] I'm here without you baby\[G]
    But you're still on my lonely m\[Am]ind
    I think about you baby
    \[F]And I dream a\[G]bout you all the time
    \[C] I'm here without you baby
    \[G] But you're still with me in my d\[Am]reams
    And t\[F]onight, there's \[G]only you and me
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    The \[Am]miles just keep rollin'
    As the \[G]people leave their way to say he\[Am]llo \[F G]
    I've heard this \[Am]life is overrated
    But I \[G]hope that it gets better as we \[Am]go \[F G]
  \endverse

  \textnote{Chorus}

  \beginverse*
    \[Am] Everything I know,\[C] and anywhere I go
    \[G] It gets hard but it won't \[F]take away my love
    \[Am] And when the last one falls,\[C] when it's all said and \[G]done
    It gets hard but it won't \[F]take away my \[F]love \[C G Am F G]
